# DraftWolf

**Because "final_final_v2.blend" is a lie we tell ourselves.**

DraftWolf helps you keep your drafts and files under control—without learning Git or complicated tools. Open a folder, save versions as you go, and jump back to any previous version whenever you need it.

---

## Who is it for?

- **Writers** – Scripts, articles, novels. Save snapshots and restore earlier drafts without a mess of copies.
- **Creators** – Keep reference images and notes next to your files. See history and metadata in one place.
- **Anyone with version chaos** – If your folder is full of `doc_v1`, `doc_FINAL`, `doc_REALLY_FINAL`, DraftWolf replaces that with a simple version history.

---

## What can you do?

- **Save versions** – While you work, save named versions (e.g. “First draft”, “Before edits”). Your history is kept in order.
- **Restore anytime** – Restore an old version without losing the current one. DraftWolf branches it so you can compare or go back.
- **Inspector panel** – Click a file to see its details, tasks, attachments, and full version history in one panel.
- **Attachments & previews** – Attach images or references to a file and preview them, including full-screen.
- **Tasks & metadata** – Add to-dos and notes to specific files so context stays with the file.
- **Community** – Join channels, chat, and polls (when you’re signed in).
- **Wolfbrain** – Use the moodboard and extension to organize ideas and references.

## How to use it (basics)

1. **Open a workspace** – Open or create a folder where your drafts live.
2. **Select a file** – Click a file in the list.
3. **Open the Inspector** – Use the panel on the right to see **Info**, **Attachments**, and **Versions**.
4. **Save a version** – In the **Versions** tab, click **+ New Version**, add a label (e.g. “Before rewrite”), and commit.
5. **Restore** – In the version list, use **Restore** on any version to bring it back. Your current work is kept as a branch so nothing is lost.
